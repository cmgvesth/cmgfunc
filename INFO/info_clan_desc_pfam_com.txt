1	EGF superfamily	3367	PF01414,PF04863,PF00053,PF07645,PF00008,PF07974,PF09064,PF09289,PF12661,PF12662,PF12946,PF12947	Members of this clan all belong to the EGF superfamily.  This particular superfamily is characterised as having least 6 cysteines residues.\t\t\t\t   These cysteine form disulphide bonds, in the order 1-3, 2-4, 5-6, which are essential for the stability of  the EGF fold.    These disulphide bonds are stacked in a ladder-like arrangement.  The Laminin EGF family is distinguished by having an an additional disulphide bond.  The function of the domains within  this family remains unclear, but they are though to largely  perform a structural role.  More often than not, there domains are arranged a tandem repeats in extracellular proteins.
3	Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain	516	PF00536,PF02198,PF07647,PF09235,PF13543	SAM domains are found in a diverse set of proteins, which include  scaffolding proteins, transcription regulators, translational  regulators tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases [1-3].   SAM domains are found in all eukaryotes and some bacteria [3] .   Structures of SAM domains reveal a common five helical structure.  The SAM domain is involved in a variety of functions. The most widespread function is in domain-domain interactions.   The SAM domain performs domain-domain interactions using multifarious  arrangements of the SAM domain.  More recently, the SAM domain within  the Smaug protein has been demonstrated to bind to the Nanos 3' UTR translation control element (Rfam:RF00161) [3]. This clan currently only represents the diverse SAM domain family and does not contain the more divergent SAM/Pointed family (Pfam:PF02198).
4	Concanavalin-like lectin/glucanase superfamily	1929	PF03935,PF00722,PF02210,PF00337,PF00457,PF01670,PF00840,PF00054,PF03388,PF00139,PF00354,PF02973,PF06439,PF07953,PF10287,PF13385	This superfamily includes a diverse range of carbohydrate binding domains and glycosyl hydrolase enzymes that share a common structure.
5	Kazal like domain	227	PF00050,PF07648	Kazal domains are found in both serine protease inhibitors and extracellular regions of agrins. The structure of the Kazal domain is a small alpha/beta fold. Typically the Kazal domain consists of 2 short-helices and a  3-stranded anti-parallel sheet.  The fold is contains several disulphide bonds. 
6	Protein kinase C, C1 domain	516	PF03107,PF00130,PF00569,PF07649,PF07975	The members of this clan are all variations of the protein kinase C1 domain that is characterised by a rich cysteine and histidine content.  The C1 domain is the N-terminal region of conservation found in protein kinase C domains.  This domain is involved in binding many ligands, which include diacylglycerol, phorbol  esters and zinc [1].
7	K-Homology (KH) domain Superfamily	395	PF00013,PF07650,PF13014,PF13083,PF13184	The KH domain is thought to be the second most prevalent RNA  binding motif in proteins.  The motif is characterised by a  conserved GXXXGXXG in the middle of the domain.  Structures of KH reveal that the KH domain is arranged as either a  beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta (mini-KH domain) or  beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha (maxi-KH domain).  The secondary elements are separated by at least four loop segments. The second loop is located between beta-1 and al  The KH domain can be found either as single or multiple copies.  The KH domain usually binds RNA as a multimer.
9	ENTH/ANTH/VHS superfamily	64	PF00790,PF01417,PF07651	This clan includes the related ENTH and ANTH domains as well as the VHS domain. The ENTH domain is approximately 150 residues in length and is a solenoid of alpha-helices. The various ENTH domains have various lipid specificities but the key feature that distinguishes it functionally from ANTH domains is its ability to bend membranes. It does  this by folding an additional N-terminal helix on lipid binding. The ANTH domain is approximately 300 residues in length and is a PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding domain. It has no membrane bending properties. The VHS (Vps-27, Hrs and STAM) domain is a 140 residue long domain present in the very NH2-terminus of at least 60 proteins. Based on their functional characteristics and on recent data on the involvement of VHS in cargo recognition in trans-Golgi, VHS domains are considered to have a general membrane targeting/cargo recognition role in vesicular trafficking [5].
10	Src homology-3 domain	1325	PF00018,PF06347,PF07653,PF08239,PF08460,PF12913,PF13457	Src homology-3 (SH3) domains are comprised of about 60 amino acids, performing either an assembly or regulatory role.\t       For example, SH3 domains in the Grb2 adaptor protein  are essential for protein-protein interactions and\t\t      signal transduction in the p21 Ras-dependent growth factor signaling pathway.  Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].

Examples include antibodies, the giant muscle kinase titin and receptor tyrosine kinases.  Immunoglobulin-like domains may be involved in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. The superfamily can be divided into discrete structural sets, by the presence or absence of beta-strands in the structure and the  length of the domains [1]. Proteins containing domains of the C1 and V-sets are mostly molecules of the vertebrate immune system. Proteins of the C2-set are mainly lymphocyte antigens, this differs from the composition of the C2-set as originally proposed [1]. The I-set is intermediate in structure between the C1 and V-sets and is found widely in cell surface proteins as well as intracellular muscle proteins.

39	HUP - HIGH-signature proteins, UspA, and PP-ATPase.	691	PF00875,PF00579,PF00764,PF00733,PF01747,PF01467,PF01902,PF01012,PF02540,PF02569,PF01507,PF02568,PF00133,PF00749,PF00750,PF01406,PF01921,PF03054,PF01171,PF00582,PF05636,PF06508,PF06574,PF08218,PF09334,PF13603	The HUP class contains the HIGH-signature proteins, UspA superfamily and the PP-ATPase superfamily [1]. The HIGH superfamily has the HIGH Nucleotidyl transferases and the class I tRNA synthetases both of  which have the HIGH and the KMSKS motif [1],[2]. The PP-loop ATPase  named after the ATP PyroPhosphatase domain, was initially  identified as a conserved amino acid sequence motif in four distinct groups of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of the alpha-beta phosphate bond of ATP, namely GMP synthetases, argininosuccinate synthetases, asparagine synthetases, and ATP sulfurylases [3]. The USPA superfamily  contains USPA, ETFP and Photolyases [1]
40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	270	PF03099,PF01409,PF03590,PF04424,PF00152,PF00587,PF01411,PF02091,PF13393	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).
41	Death Domain Superfamily	451	PF00531,PF00619,PF01335,PF02758	The death domain superfamily is composed of three families: the death domain (DD); the death effector domain (DED) and the caspase recruitment domain (CARD).  All of the members perform a pivotal role in signalling events that regulate apoptosis.   Protein-protein interactions are mediated by self-self associations, in which CARD-CARD, DD-DD and  DED-DED contacts are formed exclusively The three families possess remarkably similar structures, each comprising an antiparallel six helical bundle in the Greek Key topology.  Structurally, the DD and CARD families are the most dissimilar.  The former is comprised of two perpendicular three-helix bundles, whereas the latter CARD domain contains six helices that are almost parallel with each other.  Interestingly, the interactions in CARD or DD containing heterodimers are quite different [1]. 
42	Flavoprotein	189	PF00258,PF03358,PF02525,PF07972,PF12641,PF12682,PF12724	Members of this clan are FMN or FAD-binding redox proteins.  Flavoproteins act in various electron-transport systems as  functional analogues of ferredoxin.  They are characterised by an open twisted alpha/beta structure consisting of five parallel  beta-sheets connected by alpha-helices which surround the sheet.
43	Chelatase Superfamily	36	PF01903,PF00762,PF06180	Metallated tetrapyrroles are used as prosthetic groups in  proteins involved in biologically important processes such as  photosynthesis, oxygen transport, drug metabolism and  nitric oxide synthesis. In living organisms, metallation is catalysed  by a group of enzymes called chelatases. This clan contains  ferrochelatase (heme) and cobalt chelatase [1]. 
44	Ferritin-like Superfamily	103	PF03713,PF00210,PF03232,PF03405,PF05067,PF05138,PF02332,PF00268,PF02915,PF05974,PF06175,PF07875,PF09537,PF09968,PF12902,PF13628,PF13668,PF13794	The members of this clan all share a distinctive four helical bundle. The four helices are arranged antiparallel with a left-handed twist. This helical bundle is distinguished from others by the long connection between the second and third helices.  Some of the members contain a Fe or Mn dimer at the centre of the helical bundle.  The ferritin fold was first described by Murzin AG and Chothia C, Cur Opin Struc Biol 1992, 2:895-903.
45	Rubredoxin-like	43	PF00301,PF01215,PF06397,PF10276	The Rubredoxin clan is comprised of three families:Rubredoxin, COX5B and desulforedoxin.Rubredoxin domains are small domains  (5-6 kDa) and bind one iron atom tetrahedrally bound by four cysteine  residues.Similar, desulforedoxin domains are small (4 kDa), but  usually form homodimers.  Each monomer binds one iron atom, but in  a distorted tetrahedral arrangement.  COX5B domains are membrane-anchored  rubredoxin-like domains. The domain in the Rubredoxin clan are usually comprised of 2 alpha helixes and 2-3 beta strands.
46	Thiolase-like Superfamily	1337	PF00109,PF02801,PF00195,PF02797,PF01154,PF00108,PF02803,PF07451,PF08392,PF08540,PF08541,PF08545,PF13723	Thiolases are ubiquitous and form a large superfamily. Thiolases can function either degradatively, in the beta-oxidation  pathway of fatty acids, or biosynthetically. Biosynthetic thiolases  catalyse the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA from two molecules of  acetyl-CoA . This is one of the fundamental categories of carbon  skeletal assembly patterns in biological systems and is the first step  in a wide range of biosynthetic pathways [1].  Thiolase are usually dimeric or tetrameric enzymes.  Within each monomer there are two similar domains related by pseudo dyad.  The N-terminal of these two domains contains a large insertion of about 100 amino  acids.
47	Copper amine oxidase, domains 1 and 2	24	PF02727,PF02728	Copper amine oxidase (CuAO) are comprised of three of four domains. In the case of the four domain CuAO, the N-terminal domain (termed N1, and is not present in the three domain CuAO) and the C-terminal catalytic domain sandwich two repeated domains (termed N2 and N3).  The function of these two homologous domains is uncertain.  N2 and N3 both have a cystatin-like fold [1].
48	Lipoprotein localisation factors LolA/B	5	PF03548,PF03550	Gram-negative bacteria lipoproteins are anchored to the periplasmic  surface of the inner or outer membrane depending on the sorting signal, which is the residue at position 2 of the polypeptide. Five Lol proteins  are involved in the sorting and membrane localisation of lipoprotein. An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, LolCDE, releases outer  membrane-specific lipoproteins from the inner membrane, causing the  formation of a complex between the released lipoproteins and the  periplasmic molecular chaperone LolA. When this complex interacts with  outer membrane receptor LolB, the lipoproteins are transferred from LolA  to LolB and then localised to the outer membrane. The structures of LolA  and LolB are remarkably similar to each other. Both have a hydrophobic  cavity consisting of an unclosed beta-barrel and an alpha-helical  lid [1,2].
49	Tudor domain 'Royal family'	521	PF02820,PF00567,PF02294,PF00385,PF01393,PF00855,PF05641,PF06003,PF07039,PF08605,PF09038,PF11717	This clan covers the Tudor domain 'royal family' [1]. This includes chromo, MBT, PWWP and tudor domains.  The chromo domain is a comprised of approximately 50 amino acid residues. There are usually one to three Chromo domains found in a single protein. In some chromo domain containing proteins, a second related chromo domain has been found and is referred to as the Chromo-shadow domain.  The structure of the Chromo and Chromo-shadow domains reveal an OB-fold, a fold found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding proteins.\tMore specifically,the chromo-domain structure reveals a three beta strands that are packed against an alpha helix. Interestingly, a similar structure is found in the archaeal chromatin proteins (7kDa DNA-binding domain).  These are sequence neutral DNA binding proteins.\tThe DNA binding in these archaeal proteins is mediated through the triple stranded beta sheet. These archaeal domains are though to represent an ancestral chromo domain. Homologs of the chromo domain have been found in fission yeast, ciliated protozoa and all animal species, but appear to be absent in eubacteria, budding yeast and plants [2]. The precise function of the chromo domain is unclear, but the chromo domain is thought to act as a targeting module for chromosomal proteins, although the chromosomal contexts and functional contexts being targeted vary.  In all cases studies, the chromo domains are found in proteins that are involved in transcription regulation, positive and negative [2].
50	HotDog superfamily	196	PF03061,PF01643,PF02551,PF03756,PF01575,PF07977,PF09500,PF10862,PF13279,PF13452,PF13622	The HotDog fold was first observed in the structure of Escherichia coli beta-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydratase (FabA), where Leesong et al. noticed that each subunit of this dimeric enzyme contained a mixed alpha + beta 'hot dog' fold. They described the seven-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet as the 'bun', which wraps around a five-turn alpha-helical 'sausage', This superfamily contains a diverse range of enzymes. Membership includes numerous prokaryotic, archaeal and eukaryotic proteins involved in several related, but distinct, catalytic activities, from metabolic roles such as thioester hydrolysis in fatty acid metabolism, to degradation of phenylacetic acid and the environmental pollutant 4-chlorobenzoate. The superfamily also includes FapR, a non-catalytic bacterial homologue that is involved in transcriptional regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis [1].
51	NTF2-like superfamily	259	PF00866,PF04280,PF02136,PF03284,PF02982,PF04335,PF05223,PF07080,PF07107,PF07366,PF07858,PF07961,PF08332,PF10184,PF10429,PF11533,PF12680,PF12707,PF12870,PF12893,PF13474,PF13577	This superfamily contains a variety of enzymes such as Scytalone dehydratase, Delta-5-3-ketosteroid isomerase, Limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase among others. The family also includes presumed non-enzymatic homologues such as NTF2.
52	NTN hydrolase superfamily	211	PF01019,PF04916,PF01804,PF00227,PF03417,PF01112,PF02275,PF00310,PF03577,PF09147,PF12481,PF13230,PF13522,PF13537	In the N-terminal nucleophile aminohydrolases (Ntn hydrolases) the N-terminal residue provides two catalytic groups, nucleophile and proton donor. These enzymes use the side chain of the amino-terminal residue, incorporated in a beta-sheet, as the nucleophile in the catalytic attack at the carbonyl carbon. The nucleophile is cysteine in GAT, serine in penicillin acylase, and threonine in the proteasome. All the enzymes share an unusual fold in which the nucleophile and other catalytic groups occupy equivalent sites. This fold provides both the capacity for nucleophilic attack and the possibility of autocatalytic processing [1].
53	4-helical cytokine superfamily	29	PF02404,PF01110,PF00758,PF02947,PF01109,PF00103,PF00714,PF00726,PF03039,PF00715,PF02059,PF00727,PF02025,PF00489,PF00143,PF03487,PF02024,PF01291,PF06875,PF07400	Cytokines are regulatory peptides that can be produced by various cells for communicating and orchestrating the large multicellular system. Cytokines are key mediators of hematopoiesis, immunity, allergy, inflammation, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and embryonic development [2]. This superfamily includes both the long and short chain helical cytokines.
54	Scorpion toxin-like knottin superfamily	11	PF01097,PF00304,PF00451,PF00537,PF05294,PF06876,PF07333,PF08086,PF10868,PF11415	This clan includes a number of toxin families that share the knottin structure. These families come from scorpions, plants and arthropods.
55	Positive stranded ssRNA viruses coat protein	126	PF01766,PF01318,PF00915,PF02443,PF02247,PF00760,PF00894,PF03391,PF03566,PF01829,PF00073,PF03014,PF02956,PF00983,PF00729,PF08762,PF11729	The clan contains a set of viral coat protein families and peptidase A6. The only known peptidase  activity is an autolytic cleavage releasing a 44-residue  C-terminal fragment. The reaction is very slow and only occurs  within the assembled virion. There is debate whether this is actually a true peptidase. The virion with these coat or capsid\tproteins are icosahedral viruses containing sixty triangular  coat protein units, each unit consisting of three proteins. The coat  protein consists of two subdomains, an eight-stranded beta-barrel on  the surface and a three-helix bundle on the inner face.
56	C-type lectin-like superfamily	547	PF03440,PF01413,PF00059,PF00193,PF05473,PF05966,PF07979	This clan contains domains that have a C-type lectin fold.  Many of these are known or expected to  mediate interactions with sugars.

58	Tim barrel glycosyl hydrolase superfamily	1976	PF00150,PF00704,PF02055,PF01055,PF05089,PF02446,PF00128,PF01120,PF02638,PF03537,PF03198,PF00232,PF00331,PF01373,PF00332,PF00728,PF01183,PF02156,PF02836,PF00933,PF01301,PF01229,PF02449,PF01630,PF02057,PF02324,PF03662,PF02065,PF05691,PF07555,PF07745,PF10566,PF11308,PF11790,PF12876,PF12888,PF12891,PF12905,PF13199,PF13200,PF13204	This large superfamily contains a range of glycosyl hydrolase enzymes that possess a TIM barrel fold. This CLAN merges clans GH-A, GH-D, GH-H and GH-K from CAZy.
59	Six-hairpin glycosidase superfamily	693	PF04685,PF01532,PF03200,PF03663,PF01122,PF00723,PF02011,PF03632,PF01270,PF00759,PF00432,PF01204,PF05592,PF06202,PF06662,PF06824,PF07221,PF07470,PF07678,PF07944,PF09492,PF10091,PF10988,PF12899,PF13243,PF13249,PF13345,PF13349	This Clan includes CAZy clans GH-L, GH-M and GH-G. The members of this clan share a common structure composed of 6 helical hairpins. Most members of this superfamily are glycosyl hydrolase enzymes.
60	DNA clamp superfamily	50	PF02916,PF04005,PF00712,PF02767,PF02768,PF00705,PF02747,PF02144,PF04139,PF02282	Sliding DNA clamps are ring-shaped proteins that allow DNA polymerase to achieve high processivity during chromosome replication by tethering the polymerase catalytic subunit to DNA. All of the structures share a 12-fold symmetry around the ring consisting of a simple structural repeat, though there is structural divergence in some of the repeats. Bacterial beta-clamps contain six repeats per subunit with two subunits per ring while the eukaryotic and bacteriophage clamps contain four repeats per subunit with three subunits per ring. Pairs of these repeats form a domain, which has been termed the 'processivity fold'; thus the ring of the sliding clamp contains six domains and therefore is often described as having 6-fold symmetry. A structural representative of a fourth family of processivity fold proteins, namely the herpes simplex virus UL42 protein, is also available. UL42 does not form a ring-shaped clamp, however, but rather functions as a monomer and interacts with DNA quite differently than do sliding clamps; it has been suggested that UL42 resembles a primitive ancestor of sliding clamps [2].
61	PLP dependent aminotransferase superfamily	446	PF04864,PF00155,PF00202,PF00266,PF01212,PF01053,PF01041,PF02347,PF01276,PF00282,PF03841,PF00464,PF05889,PF06838,PF12897	This superfamily contains a variety of PLP-dependent enzymes.
62	APC superfamily	315	PF01490,PF03594,PF00955,PF02705,PF00324,PF02554,PF01235,PF01566,PF03845,PF00474,PF00916,PF02133,PF03222,PF00860,PF05525,PF13520,PF13792,PF13906	This large superfamily contains a variety of transporters including amino acid permeases that according to TCDB belong to the APC (Amino acid-Polyamine-organoCation) superfamily.

One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.
64	CPA/AT transporter superfamily	142	PF03547,PF00999,PF03601,PF03956,PF03616,PF03812,PF03977,PF01758,PF05684,PF05982,PF06826,PF06965,PF13593	This Clan contains transporter proteins that belong to the CPA superfamily and AT superfamily according to TCDB [1].
65	Cyclin-like superfamily	111	PF00134,PF03261,PF02984,PF01858,PF01857,PF00382,PF08613	This Clan contains cyclins, Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), and the Retinoblastoma tumour suppressor proteins. These were predicted to be related by sequence [1].
66	Beta-trefoil superfamily	573	PF02815,PF00652,PF03498,PF04601,PF00167,PF00340,PF00197,PF05270,PF05588,PF06229,PF06268,PF07468,PF07951,PF08709,PF14200	This family corresponds to a large set of related beta-trefoil proteins [1].  The beta-trefoil is formed by six two-stranded hairpins [2]. Three of these form a barrel structure and the other three are in a triangular array that caps the barrel. The arrangement of the secondary structures gives the molecules a pseudo 3-fold axis.
67	SIS domain fold	72	PF00342,PF01380,PF10740,PF13580	This catalytic domain catalyses isomerisation reactions of a variety of sugars [1].
68	RIIa-like fold	55	PF05186,PF02197	This clan includes both the RIIa dimerisation motif as well as the Dpy-30-like motif [1].
69	GFP-like superfamily	75	PF01353,PF07474	This superfamily has an unusual fold of an 11 stranded beta barrel enclosing an alpha-helix. This superfamily includes green fluorescent protein as well as a domain from nidogen.

71	Histidine phosphatase superfamily	134	PF00328,PF00300	The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because catalysis centres on a conserved His residue that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle.  Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue.  Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue.  The superfamily may be divided into two main branches [1].
72	Ubiquitin superfamily	1072	PF02017,PF00564,PF02824,PF02597,PF00240,PF00789,PF03671,PF04110,PF02991,PF00794,PF00788,PF02196,PF03658,PF06071,PF06234,PF06251,PF06805,PF07023,PF07715,PF08783,PF08817,PF09138,PF09379,PF10302,PF10531,PF11470,PF11543,PF11973,PF11976,PF12754,PF13019,PF13881,PF14451,PF14452,PF14453,PF14454	This family includes proteins that share the ubiquitin fold. It currently unites four SCOP superfamilies.

74	Retroviral matrix superfamily	85	PF01140,PF02337,PF00540,PF02228,PF02813	This clan brings together matrix proteins from a variety of retroviruses.
75	Defensin/myotoxin-like superfamily	12	PF00711,PF00323,PF00706,PF07936,PF08131,PF13841	This clan includes diverse defensins as well as myotoxins.
76	Riboflavin synthase/Ferredoxin reductase FAD binding domain	276	PF00970,PF00667,PF00677,PF08021,PF08022	Riboflavin nucleotide coenzymes and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are essential cofactors for a large number of flavoproteins involved in a diverse set of redox reactions.  There are thought to be four different FAD-binding folds [1].The FAD-binding fold of this clan is a cylindrical  beta-fold. More specifically, the domain forms a flattened six-stranded  antiparallel beta-barrel organised into two orthogonal sheets  (1-2-5 and 4-3-6) separated by one alpha-helix. The cylinder is open  between strands strand 4 and 5. This opening of the cylinder makes space  for the isoalloxazine and ribityl moieties of the FAD, to which hydrogen  bonds are formed from the open edges of the strands. The other end of  the cylinder is covered by the only helix of the domain,  which is essential for the binding of the pyrophosphate groups of the  FAD [1].The structural differences in the FAD-binding domain are  manifested mainly as loops of different length and extra extending  structural elements, which may be important for interactions with their  redox partners [1]. The structural core of all clan members is highly  conserved.
77	PCMH-like FAD binding	184	PF01565,PF00941	The FAD-binding domains contained in this family fall within the PCMH (p-cresol methyl-hydroxylase) family of FAD binding proteins as defined in [1].  In this family, the structure of the FAD binding domain is comprised of two subdomains.  Both of these subdomains have an alpha-beta fold.  The first subdomain is comprised of three parallel beta strands,  surrounded by alpha helices.  The second subdomain contains five antiparallel beta strands, also surrounded by alpha helices. The junction between these two subdomains forms the FAD bind pocket, where the ligand is bound by hydrogen and van der Waals bonds [1].
78	DNA/RNA ligase superfamily	123	PF01068,PF01653,PF01331,PF09414	This superfamily contains both ATP-dependent and NAD dependent DNA ligase enzymes.  The family also includes mRNA capping enzymes.  The members of this clan were shown to be related by sequence in [1].
79	Cystine-knot cytokine superfamily	49	PF02035,PF00007,PF03045,PF00236,PF00243,PF00341,PF00019,PF05463,PF05806	The cytokine families in this clan have the cystine-knot fold.  In this 6 cysteines form three disulphide bridges that are interlinked.
80	Mss4-like superfamily	29	PF04421,PF01641,PF00838	This clan contains TCTP, Mss4 and SelR families [1].
81	MBD-like DNA-binding domain	92	PF00847,PF01429,PF02920	This clan contains proteins with a distinctive three stranded DNA-binding domain [1].
82	Tautomerase/MIF superfamily	16	PF02962,PF01187,PF01361,PF08921	This clan groups 5-(carboxymethyl)-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase (CHMI) and 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) with macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF).  Interestingly they all share an amino-terminal proline. Members of this clan for homotrimers [1].
83	Omega toxin-like	21	PF02950,PF05039,PF02819,PF05374,PF05980,PF06357,PF07473,PF07740,PF07945,PF08027,PF08087,PF08091,PF08092,PF08093,PF08094,PF08099,PF08117,PF11478,PF11703	This clan contains a set of related small protein toxins and what appears to be the functionally distinct Albumin I domain. All members of this clan have a knottin-like fold.  Additional information about this clan may be found from [1].  
84	ADP-ribosylation Superfamily	223	PF01129,PF03496,PF02763,PF01375,PF00644,PF02917	The members of this clan all represent ADP-ribosylating catalytic domains.  The structurally conserved regions are located at the NAD binding region [1]. According to SCOP, the ADP-ribosylation domain is  thought to have an "unusual fold".
85	DHS-like NAD/FAD-binding domain	143	PF02552,PF01916,PF00766,PF02233,PF02146,PF00205,PF13289	The members of this family adopt a Rossmann fold, similar to CLAN:CL0063. However, the members of this family are distinguished in that the FAD/NAD cofactor is bound in the opposite direction.  In this arrangement, the adenosine moiety is found bound at the  second half of the fold.\t   In addition, the conserved GxGxxG motif found in classical NADP binding Rossmann folds is absent.  Finally, another distinguishing characteristic is the formation of an internal hydrogen bond in the FAD molecule [1].
86	FAD-linked oxidoreductase	24	PF02219,PF01619	The members of this clan adopt a TIM barrel fold, which is reminiscent of flavin mononucleotide binding proteins, rather than one similar to other flavin adenine dinucleotide binding domains. However, the way the FAD cofactor binds in quite different compared to  the binding of FMN in the TIM-barrel structures [1].
87	Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, C-terminal domain-like	108	PF00441,PF03241,PF01756,PF08028	The Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FAD binding domain forms an mostly alpha helical domain, comprised of four helices\tarranged in up-and-down bundle. In Acyl-CoA oxidase II this domain appears to have been duplicated.
88	Alkaline phosphatase-like	274	PF00245,PF02995,PF01663,PF00884,PF01676,PF04185,PF07394,PF08665	The members of this clan all share a common structure of their catalytic domains, which contain conserved metal binding residues [1].
89	GlnB-like superfamily	42	PF02641,PF03091,PF00543,PF06153,PF08029,PF09413,PF10126,PF11582,PF12122	The members of this clan are characterised by the fact the domains, each comprised of four beta-strand and two alpha helices, tend to form tetrameric structures [1].
90	Globin-like	57	PF00042,PF01152,PF00502	The globin fold is an evolutionary conserved six helical fold that is  found in bacteria and eukaryotes.
91	Ferredoxin / Ferric reductase-like NAD binding	269	PF00175,PF08030	The Ferredoxin / Ferric reductase-like NAD binding domain is  adopts a Rossmann like fold.  However, these families have been excluded from the classical NAD(P) binding Rossmann clan (CLAN:CL0063), due to a divergence of the GxGxxG motif.  In this clan, the motif phosphate binding motif is G-T/S-G-A/I-P.  The changes in the motif are a reflection of the different way that the NAD(P)H is bound by this fold and the classical Rossmann fold [1,2].
92	Actin depolymerizing Factor	124	PF00626,PF00241	For motile cells such as Amoeba to move, there must be the rapid recycling of their actin cytoskeleton to enable a dynamic change in their shape. Gelsolin (PFAM:PF00626) and Cofilin (PFAM:PF00241) are  two key domain families in this process.  Both of these domain are  structural and functional similar [1,2].  In particular, the beta sheet found at the core of the domain is structurally well conserved, with the helices that surround this sheet less conserved[2]. 
93	Peptidase clan CD	856	PF01650,PF00656,PF03415,PF01364,PF03568,PF11713,PF12770,PF13900	The members of this clan are all endopeptidase that have the catalytic dyad histidine followed by cysteine.  The catalytic histidine is preceded  by a block of hydrophobic residues and a glycine, where as the cysteine is preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues and a glutamine and an alanine. The members with a know structure adopt an alpha/beta fold [1].
94	LuxS/MPP-like metallohydrolase	60	PF05193,PF02664,PF00675,PF03410	All members of this clan are characterised by a HXXEH motif, which is  is involved in zinc binding.  Furthermore all members adopt an alpha and  beta fold. More specifically, there us a four to six stranded antiparallel beta sheet surrounded by five helices. However, LuxS (PFAM:PF02664) is not a peptidase, although its hydrolytic mechanism of catalysis appears to be conserved [1].
95	Peptidase Clan ML	9	PF01750,PF03418,PF06866	This clan contains HybD-like domains.  HybD is a nickel binding  endopeptidase.  Structural and sequences analyses have highlighted the  presence of two highly conserved motifs that are shared with germination proteases and HybD [1].  Members of this clan adopt an alpha/beta fold,  comprised of a central beta sheet, surrounded by alpha helices.
96	Peptidase Inhibitor Clan IE	2	PF02977,PF00299	The members of this clan are all cystine rich domains, which form a knottin scaffold.  This clan should also contain alpha-amylase but currently this family is a singleton and can not be put into Pfam. Also see [1].
97	Type III secretory system chaperone	12	PF05932,PF07824,PF10722	The translocation of pathogenic proteins into a host cell is mediated by the type III secretory system. A component of this system is a  chaperone, which binds to the protein which is going to be secreted in the bacterial cytosol and is involved in translocation of the secreted  protein, although the chaperone is not translocated itself. An individual  chaperone associates with one or two specific proteins [1].  There are a large number of type III secretory system chaperones, which are small acidic proteins and exhibit significant sequence divergence.   This clan groups type III secretory system chaperones. Members with a  known structure form small compact globular domains with an alpha-beta(3)- alpha-beta(2)-alpha like organisation [1].
98	SPOUT Methyltransferase Superfamily	70	PF04013,PF01994,PF02590,PF02598,PF04452,PF00588,PF01746,PF04252,PF09895,PF09936,PF14419	A distinct class of methylases that includes the SpoU and TrmD  superfamilies and two superfamilies of predicted methylases defined  by the YbeA and MJ0421 proteins in bacteria and archaea,  respectively [1] (PFAM:PF00588 PFAM:PF01746). SPOUT is  structurally  distinct  compared to more classical methyltransferases [1]. More specifically, the members of this clan form alpha/beta knots. Knots are extremely rare in protein structures as they pose a\tfolding problem. The mechanism that allow a domain to be folded as a knot are unclear, but are discussed in [2] and reference therein. All members with known structure form homodimers.
99	ALDH-like superfamily	102	PF00171,PF00815,PF05893,PF07368	The aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a superfamily of multimeric  enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of a broad range of aldehydes into  their corresponding carboxylic acids with the reduction of their cofactor, NAD(P) into NAD(P)H.  The way that the NAD is bound is distinct from other NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases.  The domain represented by this  clan consists of two similar subdomains.
100	C1q and TNF superfamily	44	PF00386,PF00229	The members of the C1q and TNF superfamily are involved in a diverse set  of functions, which include: defense, inflammation, apoptosis, autoimmunity differentiation, organogenesis, hibernation and insulin-resistant\tobesity [1].  Both C1q and TNF domains form a compact jelly-roll beta- sandwich.  The core of these structures are conserved between the two families and corresponds to the detectable sequence similarity. Proteins containing both of these domains, form trimers before they are active.  However, the surfaces of the domains are quite different and  this difference is thought to give rise to the function difference between the clan members[1].  
101	RNA ribose binding superfamily	32	PF03465,PF01248,PF08032,PF08228	The members of this clan are all involved in binding to ribose sugar of RNA.  Indeed, the key RNA binding residues are conserved across the different families [1].  Members of this clan form mixed alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures.
103	Galactose Mutarotase-like superfamily	188	PF01263,PF02929,PF03636,PF02278,PF07748,PF13802	This clan is composed of a beta-sandwich that was first observed in domain 5 of beta-galactosidase, then as the central domain of copper amine oxidase, the C-terminal domain of chondroitinase, the C-terminal domain of hyaluronate lyase, the N-terminal domain of maltose phosphorylase and in Galactose Mutarotase [1]. All these enzymes act on a sugar substrate.
104	VOC superfamily	122	PF00903,PF06185,PF06983,PF12681,PF13468,PF13669	This clan contains the VOC metalloenzyme superfamily [1]. The known types of reactions that are catalysed include isomerizations (glyoxalase I), epimerizations (methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase), oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds (extradiol dioxygenase), and nucleophilic substitutions (fosfomycin resistance proteins) [1].
105	Barrel sandwich hybrid superfamily	560	PF01551,PF02749,PF01333,PF00364,PF01512,PF01597,PF00529,PF02321,PF00358,PF05896,PF07831,PF09891,PF10011,PF12700,PF13375,PF13437,PF13533	This superfamily contains proteins with a hybrid motif [1]. This motif is embedded in structurally diverse proteins.
106	6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase C-terminal-like superfamily	104	PF00725,PF00393,PF01450,PF00984,PF07479,PF08125	This helical domain is found associated with Rossmann domains.
107	KOW domain	66	PF00467,PF01157,PF03947,PF08207	This superfamily includes proteins involved in translation that have a KOW like SH3-fold.
108	Actin-like ATPase Superfamily	406	PF00814,PF00871,PF00022,PF01869,PF03309,PF02543,PF00370,PF02782,PF03630,PF01150,PF02685,PF05134,PF00349,PF03727,PF00012,PF01968,PF02541,PF00480,PF03702,PF05378,PF06277,PF06406,PF06723,PF07318,PF08735,PF08841,PF11104,PF13941,PF14450	The actin-like ATPase domain forms an alpha/beta canonical fold. The domain can be subdivided into 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B subdomains. Subdomains 1A and 1B share the same RNAseH-like fold (a five-stranded beta-sheet decorated by a number of alpha-helices). Domains 1A and 2A are conserved in all members of this superfamily, whereas domain 1B and 2B have a variable structure and are even missing from some homologues [1].  Within the actin-like ATPase domain the ATP-binding site is highly conserved. The phosphate part of the ATP is bound in a cleft between subdomains 1A and 2A, whereas the adenosine moiety is bound to residues from domains 2A and 2B[1].
109	Cytidine deaminase-like (CDA) superfamily	771	PF00383,PF02137,PF01808,PF05240,PF08210,PF08211,PF14421,PF14424,PF14427,PF14428,PF14431,PF14432,PF14437,PF14439,PF14440,PF14441	This clan contains both free nucleotide and nucleic acid deaminases that act on adenosine, cytosine, guanine and cytidine, and are  collectively known as the deaminase superfamily.  The conserved fold  consists of a three-layered alpha/beta/alpha structure with 3 helices  and 4 strands in the 2134 order [1,2].This superfamily is further  divided into two major divisions based on the presence of a  helix (helix-4) that renders the terminal strands (strands 4 and 5) either parallel to each other in its presence, or anti-parallel  in its absence [2]. Structurally, the deaminase-like fold is present in four other superfamilies including the JAB-like metalloproteins,  the C-terminal AICAR transformylase-catalyzing domains of PurH,  Tm1506 and the formate dehydrogenase accessory subunit FdhD. The active site of the deaminases is composed of three residues  that coordinate a zinc ion between conserved helices 2 and 3. The  residues are typically found as [HCD]xE and CxxC motifs at the  beginning of helices 2 and 3. The zinc ion activates a water  molecule, which forms a tetrahderal intermediate with the carbon  atom that is linked to the amine group. This is followed by  deamination of the base.  
110	Glycosyl transferase clan GT-A	1191	PF01697,PF02434,PF04488,PF01755,PF03360,PF01501,PF00535,PF05060,PF03452,PF03552,PF01644,PF03142,PF02348,PF01983,PF03407,PF03314,PF04646,PF01762,PF02709,PF03414,PF03071,PF01128,PF00483,PF03213,PF01704,PF05637,PF05679,PF05704,PF06306,PF09258,PF09837,PF10111,PF11051,PF11316,PF11397,PF12804,PF12919,PF13506,PF13632,PF13641,PF13704,PF13712,PF13733,PF13896	This is the GT-A clan that contains diverse glycosyltransferases that possess a Rossmann like fold [1].
111	Glycosyl transferase GT-C superfamily	255	PF03155,PF04602,PF04922,PF05208,PF04188,PF02364,PF05007,PF01277,PF03901,PF02366,PF02516,PF06728,PF07220,PF09586,PF09594,PF09852,PF09913,PF10131,PF11028,PF13231	This is the GT-C clan that contains diverse glycosyltransferases that possess 8-13 predicted transmembrane segments [1].
112	Yip1/YIF1-like	47	PF03878,PF04893,PF06304,PF06570,PF06930,PF08006	Yip1 and YIF1 are members of an integral membrane complex which bind to Ras-like GTPases and are required for membrane fusion of ER derived vesicles with the Golgi [1].
113	Glycosyl transferase clan GT-B	1285	PF04101,PF00982,PF04464,PF05159,PF04007,PF02350,PF03033,PF01075,PF00534,PF04413,PF02684,PF00343,PF04230,PF03481,PF00862,PF00201,PF05686,PF05693,PF06258,PF06722,PF06925,PF07429,PF08288,PF08323,PF08660,PF09314,PF11997,PF12000,PF13439,PF13477,PF13524,PF13528,PF13579,PF13692,PF13844	This is the GT-B clan that contains diverse glycosyltransferases that possess a Rossmann like fold [1].
114	HMG-box like superfamily	163	PF00505,PF04690,PF06244,PF06382,PF08073,PF09011	This clan includes the DNA-binding HMG-box proteins as well as the YABBY-like transcription factors.
115	Steroid oxidoreductase superfamily	44	PF02544,PF01222,PF04140,PF04191,PF06966,PF07298	This clan includes several enzymes, including steroid dehydrogenases and isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase enzymes. These protein contain a varying number of transmembrane regions.
116	Calycin superfamily	90	PF02098,PF00061,PF03724,PF02087,PF04170,PF03973,PF07137,PF08212,PF09223,PF11032,PF12182,PF12702,PF13648,PF13924,PF13944	The calycin structural superfamily [1-3] includes the lipocalins, the fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs).
117	uPAR/Ly6/CD59/snake toxin-receptor superfamily	22	PF01064,PF02988,PF00087,PF00021,PF06211	This superfamily contains snake toxins as well as extracellular cysteine rich domains.
118	Ribokinase-like superfamily	135	PF00294,PF04587,PF02110,PF01256,PF08543,PF10120	All of these enzymes are phosphotransferases that have an alcohol group as an acceptor (EC:2.7.1.-). However, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate kinase (HMPP kinase) catalyses two phosphorylation reactions: one to a hydroxymethyl group of hydroxymethyl pyrimidine (HMP) and the second to the phosphomethyl group of HMPP [1]. The common structural feature for the enzymes in this superfamily is a central eight-stranded sheet that is flanked by eight structurally conserved helices, five on one side and three on the other [1]. The active site is located in a shallow groove along one edge of the sheet, with the phosphate acceptor hydroxyl group and -phosphate of ATP close together in the middle of the groove, and substrate and ATP binding at the ends [1].
121	Cystatin-like superfamily	23	PF00666,PF00031,PF07430,PF07448	This superfamily includes cystatins and cathelicidins [1]. The cystatin superfamily comprises cysteine protease inhibitors that play key regulatory roles in protein degradation processes. The progenitor of this superfamily was most probably intracellular and lacked a signal peptide and disulfide bridges, much like the extant Giardia cystatin. A primordial gene duplication produced two ancestral eukaryotic lineages, cystatins and stefins.

The large subunit of DNA primase forms interactions with the small subunit and the structure implicates that it is not directly involved in catalysis, but plays a roles in correctly positioning the primase/DNA complex, and in the transfer of RNA to DNA polymerase [1].  The clan also contains the Lef-2 family, which is required for the expression of late genes.  There is some evidence to suggest that LEF2 binds to both DNA and the DNA primase small subunit LEF-1 [3].

The nfe genes (nfeA, nfeB, and nfeD) are involved in the nodulation efficiency and competitiveness of the Sinorhizobium meliloti strain GR4 on alfalfa roots [1]. The specific function the NfeD family is unknown although it is unlikely that NfeD is specifically involved in nodulation as the family contains several different archaeal and bacterial species most of which are not symbionts.

These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].

524	Antigen MPT63/MPB63 (immunoprotective extracellular	17	PF11611,PF14263	This superfamily is characterised by extracellular proteins with immuno-protectivce receptor domains on their surfaces resembling Ig domains. These are putative lipoproteins.
525	Acid phosphatase/Vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase	77	PF01569,PF14360,PF14378	The PAP2 superfamily is characterised by being mult-helical, with the core consisting of a 5-helical bundle. Normally the family will bind cofactor at the beginning of the third helix. The superfamily includes the enzyme type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP2), Glucose-6-phosphatase EC:3.1.3.9, Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase B EC:3.1.3.27 and bacterial acid phosphatase EC:3.1.3.2. The family also includes a variety of haloperoxidases [1,2] that function by oxidising halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to form the corresponding hypohalous acids.
526	SUKH superfamily	27	PF02393,PF07348,PF09346,PF14433,PF14435	SUKH superfamily unites a diverse group of proteins including  Smi1/Knr4, PGs2, Fbxo3, Skip16, Syd, herpesviral US22, IRS1 and TRS1, and their bacterial homologs [1].
527	Sm (Small RNA binding protein domain)	63	PF01423,PF12701,PF14438	Conserved domain of core RNA-binding proteins of mRNA splicing and rRNA processing complexes, with a SH3-like Beta-barrel
528	DUF1214-like	14	PF06742,PF06863	Members of this clan usually appear in pairs on the same sequence. In cases where there is only a single example of the domain, there is often a second protein containing a single domain that is located sequentially along the chromosome. The crystal structure of pdb:2P3Y reveals that Pfam:PF06863 and Pfam:PF06742 come together to from a deep, positively charged pocket or cleft.  Structural comparisons reveal that this may this pocket that may bind some form of carbohydrate. Conserved residues are predominantly found on the surface of the positively charged cleft [Jayaraman et al. personal communication].
