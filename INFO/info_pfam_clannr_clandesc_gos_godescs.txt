Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].	0005515	protein binding

PF00152	tRNA synthetases class II (D, K and N) 	40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).	0000166::0004812::0005524::0006418::0005737	nucleotide binding::aminoacyl-tRNA ligase activity::ATP binding::tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation::cytoplasm

PF00207	Alpha-2-macroglobulin family	11	Immunoglobulin superfamily	Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily are found in hundreds of proteins of different functions. Examples include antibodies, the giant muscle kinase titin and receptor tyrosine kinases.  Immunoglobulin-like domains may be involved in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. The superfamily can be divided into discrete structural sets, by the presence or absence of beta-strands in the structure and the  length of the domains [1]. Proteins containing domains of the C1 and V-sets are mostly molecules of the vertebrate immune system. Proteins of the C2-set are mainly lymphocyte antigens, this differs from the composition of the C2-set as originally proposed [1]. The I-set is intermediate in structure between the C1 and V-sets and is found widely in cell surface proteins as well as intracellular muscle proteins.	0004866	endopeptidase inhibitor activity
PF00208	Glutamate/Leucine/Phenylalanine/Valine dehydrogenase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0016491::0006520::0055114	oxidoreductase activity::cellular amino acid metabolic process::oxidation-reduction process

Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue.  Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue.

PF00310	Glutamine amidotransferases class-II	52	NTN hydrolase superfamily	In the N-terminal nucleophile aminohydrolases (Ntn hydrolases) the N-terminal residue provides two catalytic groups, nucleophile and proton donor. These enzymes use the side chain of the amino-terminal residue, incorporated in a beta-sheet, as the nucleophile in the catalytic attack at the carbonyl carbon. The nucleophile is cysteine in GAT, serine in penicillin acylase, and threonine in the proteasome. All the enzymes share an unusual fold in which the nucleophile and other catalytic groups occupy equivalent sites. This fold provides both the capacity for nucleophilic attack and the possibility of autocatalytic processing [1].	0008152	metabolic process

Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue.  Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue.  The superfamily may be divided into two main branches [1].	0003993	acid phosphatase activity

PF00383	Cytidine and deoxycytidylate deaminase zinc-binding region	109	Cytidine deaminase-like (CDA) superfamily	This clan contains both free nucleotide and nucleic acid deaminases that act on adenosine, cytosine, guanine and cytidine, and are  collectively known as the deaminase superfamily.  The conserved fold  consists of a three-layered alpha/beta/alpha structure with 3 helices  and 4 strands in the 2134 order [1,2].This superfamily is further  divided into two major divisions based on the presence of a  helix (helix-4) that renders the terminal strands (strands 4 and 5) either parallel to each other in its presence, or anti-parallel  in its absence [2]. Structurally, the deaminase-like fold is present in four other superfamilies including the JAB-like metalloproteins,  the C-terminal AICAR transformylase-catalyzing domains of PurH,  Tm1506 and the formate dehydrogenase accessory subunit FdhD. The active site of the deaminases is composed of three residues  that coordinate a zinc ion between conserved helices 2 and 3. The  residues are typically found as [HCD]xE and CxxC motifs at the  beginning of helices 2 and 3. The zinc ion activates a water  molecule, which forms a tetrahderal intermediate with the carbon  atom that is linked to the amine group. This is followed by  deamination of the base.  	0008270::0016787	zinc ion binding::hydrolase activity

Proteins containing both of these domains, form trimers before they are active.  However, the surfaces of the domains are quite different and  this difference is thought to give rise to the function difference between the clan members[1].  	NA	NA

One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0000179::0008649::0000154	rRNA (adenine-N6,N6-)-dimethyltransferase activity::rRNA methyltransferase activity::rRNA modification

PF00587	tRNA synthetase class II core domain (G, H, P, S and T)	40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).	0000166::0004812::0005524::0006418::0005737	nucleotide binding::aminoacyl-tRNA ligase activity::ATP binding::tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation::cytoplasm

SPOUT is  structurally  distinct  compared to more classical methyltransferases [1]. More specifically, the members of this clan form alpha/beta knots. Knots are extremely rare in protein structures as they pose a\tfolding problem. The mechanism that allow a domain to be folded as a knot are unclear, but are discussed in [2] and reference therein.

There are thought to be four different FAD-binding folds [1].The FAD-binding fold of this clan is a cylindrical  beta-fold.

The other end of  the cylinder is covered by the only helix of the domain,  which is essential for the binding of the pyrophosphate groups of the  FAD [1].The structural differences in the FAD-binding domain are  manifested mainly as loops of different length and extra extending  structural elements, which may be important for interactions with their  redox partners [1].

Bacterial beta-clamps contain six repeats per subunit with two subunits per ring while the eukaryotic and bacteriophage clamps contain four repeats per subunit with three subunits per ring. Pairs of these repeats form a domain, which has been termed the 'processivity fold'; thus the ring of the sliding clamp contains six domains and therefore is often described as having 6-fold symmetry. A structural representative of a fourth family of processivity fold proteins, namely the herpes simplex virus UL42 protein, is also available. UL42 does not form a ring-shaped clamp, however, but rather functions as a monomer and interacts with DNA quite differently than do sliding clamps; it has been suggested that UL42 resembles a primitive ancestor of sliding clamps [2].	0003677::0030337::0006275::0043626	DNA binding::DNA polymerase processivity factor activity::regulation of DNA replication::PCNA complex

PF00743	Flavin-binding monooxygenase-like	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0004499::0050660::0050661::0055114	N,N-dimethylaniline monooxygenase activity::flavin adenine dinucleotide binding::NADP binding::oxidation-reduction process

PF00970	Oxidoreductase FAD-binding domain	76	Riboflavin synthase/Ferredoxin reductase FAD binding domain	Riboflavin nucleotide coenzymes and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are essential cofactors for a large number of flavoproteins involved in a diverse set of redox reactions.  There are thought to be four different FAD-binding folds [1].The FAD-binding fold of this clan is a cylindrical  beta-fold. More specifically, the domain forms a flattened six-stranded  antiparallel beta-barrel organised into two orthogonal sheets  (1-2-5 and 4-3-6) separated by one alpha-helix. The cylinder is open  between strands strand 4 and 5. This opening of the cylinder makes space  for the isoalloxazine and ribityl moieties of the FAD, to which hydrogen  bonds are formed from the open edges of the strands. The other end of  the cylinder is covered by the only helix of the domain,  which is essential for the binding of the pyrophosphate groups of the  FAD [1].The structural differences in the FAD-binding domain are  manifested mainly as loops of different length and extra extending  structural elements, which may be important for interactions with their  redox partners [1]. The structural core of all clan members is highly  conserved.	NA	NA

The HIGH superfamily has the HIGH Nucleotidyl transferases and the class I tRNA synthetases both of  which have the HIGH and the KMSKS motif [1],[2]. The PP-loop ATPase  named after the ATP PyroPhosphatase domain, was initially  identified as a conserved amino acid sequence motif in four distinct groups of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of the alpha-beta phosphate bond of ATP, namely GMP synthetases, argininosuccinate synthetases, asparagine synthetases, and ATP sulfurylases [3].

PF01408	Oxidoreductase family, NAD-binding Rossmann fold	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0016491	oxidoreductase activity
PF01409	tRNA synthetases class II core domain (F)	40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).	0000049::0004812::0005524::0043039::0005737	tRNA binding::aminoacyl-tRNA ligase activity::ATP binding::tRNA aminoacylation::cytoplasm

PF01417	ENTH domain	9	ENTH/ANTH/VHS superfamily	This clan includes the related ENTH and ANTH domains as well as the VHS domain. The ENTH domain is approximately 150 residues in length and is a solenoid of alpha-helices. The various ENTH domains have various lipid specificities but the key feature that distinguishes it functionally from ANTH domains is its ability to bend membranes. It does  this by folding an additional N-terminal helix on lipid binding. The ANTH domain is approximately 300 residues in length and is a PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding domain. It has no membrane bending properties. The VHS (Vps-27, Hrs and STAM) domain is a 140 residue long domain present in the very NH2-terminus of at least 60 proteins. Based on their functional characteristics and on recent data on the involvement of VHS in cargo recognition in trans-Golgi, VHS domains are considered to have a general membrane targeting/cargo recognition role in vesicular trafficking [5].

One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].

PF01797	Transposase IS200 like	481	His-hydrophobic-His tranposase Y1,Y2 superfamily	This superfamily consists of families of transposases that use tyrosine as nucleophiles and contain a conserved HUH motif where U is a non-conserved hydrophobic residue. Particular examples are the Y1 and Y2 transposases. Y1 transposases come from the IS608 group and the Y2 from the IS91 group. These transposases are nucleases involved in initiating rolling-circle plasmid replication, in initiating replication of certain single-strand (ss) DNA viruses (Rep proteins), and in initiation of conjugative plasmid transfer (relaxases). The IS91 transposase contains two of the three conserved protein sequence motifs identified in RCR proteins, a His-hydrophobic-His (HUH) motif required for metal ion binding, and a YxxxY motif containing two conserved catalytic tyrosine residues. The HUH motif participates in coordinating divalent metal ions essential for catalysis.  This clan is also known as the Transposase IS200-like whose members contain extra N-terminal hairpin and C-terminal helix, both or which are involved in dimerisation; there can be helix-swapping in the dimer.	0003677::0004803::0006313	DNA binding::transposase activity::transposition, DNA-mediated

PF01804	Penicillin amidase	52	NTN hydrolase superfamily	In the N-terminal nucleophile aminohydrolases (Ntn hydrolases) the N-terminal residue provides two catalytic groups, nucleophile and proton donor. These enzymes use the side chain of the amino-terminal residue, incorporated in a beta-sheet, as the nucleophile in the catalytic attack at the carbonyl carbon. The nucleophile is cysteine in GAT, serine in penicillin acylase, and threonine in the proteasome. All the enzymes share an unusual fold in which the nucleophile and other catalytic groups occupy equivalent sites. This fold provides both the capacity for nucleophilic attack and the possibility of autocatalytic processing [1].	0016787::0017000	hydrolase activity::antibiotic biosynthetic process

PF01808	AICARFT/IMPCHase bienzyme	109	Cytidine deaminase-like (CDA) superfamily	This clan contains both free nucleotide and nucleic acid deaminases that act on adenosine, cytosine, guanine and cytidine, and are  collectively known as the deaminase superfamily.  The conserved fold  consists of a three-layered alpha/beta/alpha structure with 3 helices  and 4 strands in the 2134 order [1,2].This superfamily is further  divided into two major divisions based on the presence of a  helix (helix-4) that renders the terminal strands (strands 4 and 5) either parallel to each other in its presence, or anti-parallel  in its absence [2]. Structurally, the deaminase-like fold is present in four other superfamilies including the JAB-like metalloproteins,  the C-terminal AICAR transformylase-catalyzing domains of PurH,  Tm1506 and the formate dehydrogenase accessory subunit FdhD. The active site of the deaminases is composed of three residues  that coordinate a zinc ion between conserved helices 2 and 3. The  residues are typically found as [HCD]xE and CxxC motifs at the  beginning of helices 2 and 3. The zinc ion activates a water  molecule, which forms a tetrahderal intermediate with the carbon  atom that is linked to the amine group. This is followed by  deamination of the base.  	0003937::0004643::0006164	IMP cyclohydrolase activity::phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase activity::purine nucleotide biosynthetic process

PF01881	CRISPR associated protein Cas6	362	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins	This group of families is one of several protein families that are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].	NA	NA

PF02091	Glycyl-tRNA synthetase alpha subunit	40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).	0000166::0004820::0005524::0006426::0005737	nucleotide binding::glycine-tRNA ligase activity::ATP binding::glycyl-tRNA aminoacylation::cytoplasm

PF02153	Prephenate dehydrogenase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0004665::0008977::0006571::0055114	prephenate dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity::prephenate dehydrogenase activity::tyrosine biosynthetic process::oxidation-reduction process
PF02154	Flagellar motor switch protein FliM	355	CheC-like superfamily	The chemotactic response regulator superfamily are CheY-P phosphatases. Their structure is two intertwined alpha-beta-(X)-beta(2) motifs.

FliM is a component of the flagellar switch found across the bacteria and is responsible for binding CheY-P and changing the rotational direction of the flagella. The N-terminal domain is CheC-like and the C-terminal shares the SpoA domain with FliN and FliY. The CheC family is broadly broken down into three phosphatase subfamilies: CheC, CheX, and FliY. All three have an active site consensus sequence of D/S-X(3)-E-X(2)-N-X(22)-P.	0003774::0001539::0006935::0009425	motor activity::ciliary or bacterial-type flagellar motility::chemotaxis::bacterial-type flagellum basal body

The nucleophile is cysteine in GAT, serine in penicillin acylase, and threonine in the proteasome. All the enzymes share an unusual fold in which the nucleophile and other catalytic groups occupy equivalent sites. This fold provides both the capacity for nucleophilic attack and the possibility of autocatalytic processing [1].	0016787	hydrolase activity

PF02294	7kD DNA-binding domain	49	Tudor domain 'Royal family'	This clan covers the Tudor domain 'royal family' [1]. This includes chromo, MBT, PWWP and tudor domains.  The chromo domain is a comprised of approximately 50 amino acid residues. There are usually one to three Chromo domains found in a single protein. In some chromo domain containing proteins, a second related chromo domain has been found and is referred to as the Chromo-shadow domain.  The structure of the Chromo and Chromo-shadow domains reveal an OB-fold, a fold found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding proteins.\tMore specifically,the chromo-domain structure reveals a three beta strands that are packed against an alpha helix. Interestingly, a similar structure is found in the archaeal chromatin proteins (7kDa DNA-binding domain).  These are sequence neutral DNA binding proteins.\tThe DNA binding in these archaeal proteins is mediated through the triple stranded beta sheet. These archaeal domains are though to represent an ancestral chromo domain. Homologs of the chromo domain have been found in fission yeast, ciliated protozoa and all animal species, but appear to be absent in eubacteria, budding yeast and plants [2]. The precise function of the chromo domain is unclear, but the chromo domain is thought to act as a targeting module for chromosomal proteins, although the chromosomal contexts and functional contexts being targeted vary.  In all cases studies, the chromo domains are found in proteins that are involved in transcription regulation, positive and negative [2].	0003677::0004521	DNA binding::endoribonuclease activity

One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].

PF02916	DNA polymerase processivity factor	60	DNA clamp superfamily	Sliding DNA clamps are ring-shaped proteins that allow DNA polymerase to achieve high processivity during chromosome replication by tethering the polymerase catalytic subunit to DNA. All of the structures share a 12-fold symmetry around the ring consisting of a simple structural repeat, though there is structural divergence in some of the repeats. Bacterial beta-clamps contain six repeats per subunit with two subunits per ring while the eukaryotic and bacteriophage clamps contain four repeats per subunit with three subunits per ring. Pairs of these repeats form a domain, which has been termed the 'processivity fold'; thus the ring of the sliding clamp contains six domains and therefore is often described as having 6-fold symmetry. A structural representative of a fourth family of processivity fold proteins, namely the herpes simplex virus UL42 protein, is also available. UL42 does not form a ring-shaped clamp, however, but rather functions as a monomer and interacts with DNA quite differently than do sliding clamps; it has been suggested that UL42 resembles a primitive ancestor of sliding clamps [2].	0006260	DNA replication

PF03059	Nicotianamine synthase protein	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].

PF03099	Biotin/lipoate A/B protein ligase family	40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).	0003824::0006464	catalytic activity::cellular protein modification process

Thus, diverse mammalian receptors contain extracellular ligand binding domains that are homologous to the PBPs; these include glutamate/glycine-gated ion channels such as the NMDA receptor, G protein-coupled receptors, including metabotropic glutamate, GABA-B, calcium sensing, and pheromone receptors, and atrial natriuretic peptide-guanylate cyclase receptors [2].	0006810::0030288	transport::outer membrane-bounded periplasmic space

PF03486	HI0933-like protein	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123.

PF03590	Aspartate-ammonia ligase	40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).	0004071::0006529::0005737	aspartate-ammonia ligase activity::asparagine biosynthetic process::cytoplasm

Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123.

PF03787	RAMP superfamily	362	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins	This group of families is one of several protein families that are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].	NA	NA

The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].

The name ANL derives from from three of the subfamilies - Acyl-CoA synthetases, the NRPS adenylation domains, and the Luciferase enzymes [1].  Members of this superfamily catalyse the initial adenylation of a carboxylate to form an acyl-AMP intermediate, followed by a second partial reaction, most commonly the formation of a thioester [1].	0047474::0008218	long-chain fatty acid luciferin component ligase activity::bioluminescence

PF04445	Putative SAM-dependent methyltransferase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

SPOUT is  structurally  distinct  compared to more classical methyltransferases [1]. More specifically, the members of this clan form alpha/beta knots. Knots are extremely rare in protein structures as they pose a\tfolding problem. The mechanism that allow a domain to be folded as a knot are unclear, but are discussed in [2] and reference therein. All members with known structure form homodimers.	0008168::0006364	methyltransferase activity::rRNA processing

This superfamily comprises two classes of proteins each shown to interact with the chemotaxis response regulator CheY: the FliM switch proteins and the CheC-type phosphatases [1]. FliM is a component of the flagellar switch found across the bacteria and is responsible for binding CheY-P and changing the rotational direction of the flagella. The N-terminal domain is CheC-like and the C-terminal shares the SpoA domain with FliN and FliY. The CheC family is broadly broken down into three phosphatase subfamilies: CheC, CheX, and FliY. All three have an active site consensus sequence of D/S-X(3)-E-X(2)-N-X(22)-P.	0016787	hydrolase activity

However, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate kinase (HMPP kinase) catalyses two phosphorylation reactions: one to a hydroxymethyl group of hydroxymethyl pyrimidine (HMP) and the second to the phosphomethyl group of HMPP [1]. The common structural feature for the enzymes in this superfamily is a central eight-stranded sheet that is flanked by eight structurally conserved helices, five on one side and three on the other [1]. The active site is located in a shallow groove along one edge of the sheet, with the phosphate acceptor hydroxyl group and -phosphate of ATP close together in the middle of the groove, and substrate and ATP binding at the ends [1].	0016773::0005975	phosphotransferase activity, alcohol group as acceptor::carbohydrate metabolic process

PF04672	S-adenosyl methyltransferase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

PF04820	Tryptophan halogenase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

SHS2 is found in the bacterial cell division ATPase FtsA, the archaeo-eukaryotic RNA  polymerase subunit Rpb7p, the GyrI superfamily, and the  uncharacterized MTH1598/Tm1083-like proteins [1]. The fold exists as single copy versions in FtsA (where it is inserted into the RNAseH fold), Rbp7p and Dodecin [1]. It is found as a diad in the GyrI  superfamily. In MTH1598/Tm1083-like proteins two copies of SHS2 are found with one inserted into another [1]. The single-copy versions in FtsA and Rbp7 mediate protein–protein interactions, while the one in  Dodecin is a small molecule binding domain. The GyrI also binds small molecule, while the MTH1598 is predicted to be enzymatic [1].	NA	NA

The nucleophile is cysteine in GAT, serine in penicillin acylase, and threonine in the proteasome. All the enzymes share an unusual fold in which the nucleophile and other catalytic groups occupy equivalent sites.

PF04978	Protein of unknown function (DUF664)	310	DinB-like superfamily	This superfamily are thought to be metalloenzymes.  They possess a four helical bundle core structure with a beta hairpin. Members of the superfamily have a predicted active site composed of three histidines that chelate Nickel or Zinc.  In some cases these histidines are replaced with Aspartate or Glutamate.  Mostly they form a dimeric structure. The dinB gene is one of the DNA-damage-induced genes and the corresponding protein, DinB, is the founding member of the clan. The protein contains a four-helix up-down-down-up bundle that has previously been described in the literature in three disparate proteins: the enzyme MDMPI (mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase), YfiT and TTHA0303, a member of a small DUF (domain of unknown function).  Most (but not all) clan members seem to have the ability to coordinate a metal ion using a conserved histidine-triad motif.

PF04986	Putative transposase	481	His-hydrophobic-His tranposase Y1,Y2 superfamily	This superfamily consists of families of transposases that use tyrosine as nucleophiles and contain a conserved HUH motif where U is a non-conserved hydrophobic residue. Particular examples are the Y1 and Y2 transposases. Y1 transposases come from the IS608 group and the Y2 from the IS91 group. These transposases are nucleases involved in initiating rolling-circle plasmid replication, in initiating replication of certain single-strand (ss) DNA viruses (Rep proteins), and in initiation of conjugative plasmid transfer (relaxases). The IS91 transposase contains two of the three conserved protein sequence motifs identified in RCR proteins, a His-hydrophobic-His (HUH) motif required for metal ion binding, and a YxxxY motif containing two conserved catalytic tyrosine residues. The HUH motif participates in coordinating divalent metal ions essential for catalysis.  This clan is also known as the Transposase IS200-like whose members contain extra N-terminal hairpin and C-terminal helix, both or which are involved in dimerisation; there can be helix-swapping in the dimer.	0003677::0004803::0006313	DNA binding::transposase activity::transposition, DNA-mediated

One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].

Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

PF05430	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0016645::0055114	oxidoreductase activity, acting on the CH-NH group of donors::oxidation-reduction process

PF05433	Glycine zipper 2TM domain	500	Glycine-zipper TM superfamily	This superfamily is characterised by having long glycine-zipper motifs, characteristically GxxxGxxxG [1], often with several contiguous copies. The x following the G is frequently found to be an alanine. This sequence region can be found in both symmetric and non-symmetrical membrane structures, and is relatively common. The fact that such a large fraction of the relatively few known membrane channel structures use the glycine zipper suggests that the sequence motif plays a special role in forming these homo-oligomeric bundles [1].	0019867	outer membrane

PF05641	Agenet domain	49	Tudor domain 'Royal family'	This clan covers the Tudor domain 'royal family' [1]. This includes chromo, MBT, PWWP and tudor domains.  The chromo domain is a comprised of approximately 50 amino acid residues. There are usually one to three Chromo domains found in a single protein. In some chromo domain containing proteins, a second related chromo domain has been found and is referred to as the Chromo-shadow domain.  The structure of the Chromo and Chromo-shadow domains reveal an OB-fold, a fold found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding proteins.\tMore specifically,the chromo-domain structure reveals a three beta strands that are packed against an alpha helix. Interestingly, a similar structure is found in the archaeal chromatin proteins (7kDa DNA-binding domain).  These are sequence neutral DNA binding proteins.\tThe DNA binding in these archaeal proteins is mediated through the triple stranded beta sheet. These archaeal domains are though to represent an ancestral chromo domain. Homologs of the chromo domain have been found in fission yeast, ciliated protozoa and all animal species, but appear to be absent in eubacteria, budding yeast and plants [2]. The precise function of the chromo domain is unclear, but the chromo domain is thought to act as a targeting module for chromosomal proteins, although the chromosomal contexts and functional contexts being targeted vary.  In all cases studies, the chromo domains are found in proteins that are involved in transcription regulation, positive and negative [2].	NA	NA

PF05711	Macrocin-O-methyltransferase (TylF)	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

PF06325	Ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase (PrmA)	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0008276::0006479::0005737	protein methyltransferase activity::protein methylation::cytoplasm

PF06347	Bacterial SH3 domain	10	Src homology-3 domain	Src homology-3 (SH3) domains are comprised of about 60 amino acids, performing either an assembly or regulatory role.\t       For example, SH3 domains in the Grb2 adaptor protein  are essential for protein-protein interactions and\t\t      signal transduction in the p21 Ras-dependent growth factor signaling pathway.  Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].	NA	NA

SHS2 is found in the bacterial cell division ATPase FtsA, the archaeo-eukaryotic RNA  polymerase subunit Rpb7p, the GyrI superfamily, and the  uncharacterized MTH1598/Tm1083-like proteins [1]. The fold exists as single copy versions in FtsA (where it is inserted into the RNAseH fold), Rbp7p and Dodecin [1]. It is found as a diad in the GyrI  superfamily. In MTH1598/Tm1083-like proteins two copies of SHS2 are found with one inserted into another [1]. The single-copy versions in FtsA and Rbp7 mediate protein–protein interactions, while the one in  Dodecin is a small molecule binding domain.

PF07109	Magnesium-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase C-terminus	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0046406::0015995	magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase activity::chlorophyll biosynthetic process

PF07311	Dodecin	319	SHS2 domain	SHS2 is a novel domain with a simple fold containing a core of 3  strands, forming a curved sheet, and a single helix in a  strand-helix-strand-strand (SHS2) configuration [1]. SHS2 is found in the bacterial cell division ATPase FtsA, the archaeo-eukaryotic RNA  polymerase subunit Rpb7p, the GyrI superfamily, and the  uncharacterized MTH1598/Tm1083-like proteins [1]. The fold exists as single copy versions in FtsA (where it is inserted into the RNAseH fold), Rbp7p and Dodecin [1]. It is found as a diad in the GyrI  superfamily. In MTH1598/Tm1083-like proteins two copies of SHS2 are found with one inserted into another [1]. The single-copy versions in FtsA and Rbp7 mediate protein–protein interactions, while the one in  Dodecin is a small molecule binding domain. The GyrI also binds small molecule, while the MTH1598 is predicted to be enzymatic [1].	NA	NA

PF07647	SAM domain (Sterile alpha motif)	3	Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain	SAM domains are found in a diverse set of proteins, which include  scaffolding proteins, transcription regulators, translational  regulators tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases [1-3].   SAM domains are found in all eukaryotes and some bacteria [3] .   Structures of SAM domains reveal a common five helical structure.  The SAM domain is involved in a variety of functions. The most widespread function is in domain-domain interactions.   The SAM domain performs domain-domain interactions using multifarious  arrangements of the SAM domain.  More recently, the SAM domain within  the Smaug protein has been demonstrated to bind to the Nanos 3' UTR translation control element (Rfam:RF00161) [3].

PF07653	Variant SH3 domain	10	Src homology-3 domain	Src homology-3 (SH3) domains are comprised of about 60 amino acids, performing either an assembly or regulatory role.\t       For example, SH3 domains in the Grb2 adaptor protein  are essential for protein-protein interactions and\t\t      signal transduction in the p21 Ras-dependent growth factor signaling pathway.  Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].	NA	NA

PF07669	Eco57I restriction-modification methylase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0003677::0003824::0006304	DNA binding::catalytic activity::DNA modification

PF08020	Protein of unknown function (DUF1706)   	310	DinB-like superfamily	This superfamily are thought to be metalloenzymes.  They possess a four helical bundle core structure with a beta hairpin. Members of the superfamily have a predicted active site composed of three histidines that chelate Nickel or Zinc.  In some cases these histidines are replaced with Aspartate or Glutamate.  Mostly they form a dimeric structure. The dinB gene is one of the DNA-damage-induced genes and the corresponding protein, DinB, is the founding member of the clan. The protein contains a four-helix up-down-down-up bundle that has previously been described in the literature in three disparate proteins: the enzyme MDMPI (mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase), YfiT and TTHA0303, a member of a small DUF (domain of unknown function).  Most (but not all) clan members seem to have the ability to coordinate a metal ion using a conserved histidine-triad motif.  The proteins that share the fold exhibit four different quaternary structures: monomeric and three different dimeric forms [1].	NA	NA
PF08021	Siderophore-interacting FAD-binding domain	76	Riboflavin synthase/Ferredoxin reductase FAD binding domain	Riboflavin nucleotide coenzymes and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are essential cofactors for a large number of flavoproteins involved in a diverse set of redox reactions.  There are thought to be four different FAD-binding folds [1].The FAD-binding fold of this clan is a cylindrical  beta-fold. More specifically, the domain forms a flattened six-stranded  antiparallel beta-barrel organised into two orthogonal sheets  (1-2-5 and 4-3-6) separated by one alpha-helix. The cylinder is open  between strands strand 4 and 5. This opening of the cylinder makes space  for the isoalloxazine and ribityl moieties of the FAD, to which hydrogen  bonds are formed from the open edges of the strands. The other end of  the cylinder is covered by the only helix of the domain,  which is essential for the binding of the pyrophosphate groups of the  FAD [1].The structural differences in the FAD-binding domain are  manifested mainly as loops of different length and extra extending  structural elements, which may be important for interactions with their  redox partners [1]. The structural core of all clan members is highly  conserved.	NA	NA

The conserved fold  consists of a three-layered alpha/beta/alpha structure with 3 helices  and 4 strands in the 2134 order [1,2].This superfamily is further  divided into two major divisions based on the presence of a  helix (helix-4) that renders the terminal strands (strands 4 and 5) either parallel to each other in its presence, or anti-parallel  in its absence [2]. Structurally, the deaminase-like fold is present in four other superfamilies including the JAB-like metalloproteins,  the C-terminal AICAR transformylase-catalyzing domains of PurH,  Tm1506 and the formate dehydrogenase accessory subunit FdhD. The active site of the deaminases is composed of three residues  that coordinate a zinc ion between conserved helices 2 and 3. The  residues are typically found as [HCD]xE and CxxC motifs at the  beginning of helices 2 and 3. The zinc ion activates a water  molecule, which forms a tetrahderal intermediate with the carbon  atom that is linked to the amine group. This is followed by  deamination of the base.  	0008270::0016814	zinc ion binding::hydrolase activity, acting on carbon-nitrogen (but not peptide) bonds, in cyclic amidines

PF08239	Bacterial SH3 domain	10	Src homology-3 domain	Src homology-3 (SH3) domains are comprised of about 60 amino acids, performing either an assembly or regulatory role.\t       For example, SH3 domains in the Grb2 adaptor protein  are essential for protein-protein interactions and\t\t      signal transduction in the p21 Ras-dependent growth factor signaling pathway.  Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].	NA	NA

The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].

The PRD domain is phosphorylated on a conserved histidine residue. PRD-containing proteins are involved in the regulation of catabolic operons in Gram+ and Gram- bacteria and are often characterised by a short N-terminal effector domain that binds to either RNA (CAT-RBD for antiterminators (Pfam:PF03123, see also comments for this family)) or DNA (for activators), and a duplicated PRD module which is phosphorylated on conserved histidines by the sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) in response to the availability of carbon source. The phosphorylations are thought to modify the stability of the dimeric proteins and thereby the RNA- or DNA-binding activity of the effector domain.	NA	NA

This is one of the fundamental categories of carbon  skeletal assembly patterns in biological systems and is the first step  in a wide range of biosynthetic pathways [1].  Thiolase are usually dimeric or tetrameric enzymes.  Within each monomer there are two similar domains related by pseudo dyad.  The N-terminal of these two domains contains a large insertion of about 100 amino  acids.	0016747::0006633::0016020	transferase activity, transferring acyl groups other than amino-acyl groups::fatty acid biosynthetic process::membrane

The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].

PF08460	Bacterial SH3 domain	10	Src homology-3 domain	Src homology-3 (SH3) domains are comprised of about 60 amino acids, performing either an assembly or regulatory role.\t       For example, SH3 domains in the Grb2 adaptor protein  are essential for protein-protein interactions and\t\t      signal transduction in the p21 Ras-dependent growth factor signaling pathway.  Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].	NA	NA

The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123.

PF08659	KR domain	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

PF08798	CRISPR associated protein	362	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins	This group of families is one of several protein families that are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].	NA	NA

PF09084	NMT1/THI5 like	177	Periplasmic binding protein clan	Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) consist of two large lobes that close around the bound ligand. This architecture is reiterated in transcriptional regulators, such as the lac repressors. In the process of evolution, genes encoding the PBPs have fused with genes for integral membrane proteins. Thus, diverse mammalian receptors contain extracellular ligand binding domains that are homologous to the PBPs; these include glutamate/glycine-gated ion channels such as the NMDA receptor, G protein-coupled receptors, including metabotropic glutamate, GABA-B, calcium sensing, and pheromone receptors, and atrial natriuretic peptide-guanylate cyclase receptors [2].

These enzymes use the side chain of the amino-terminal residue, incorporated in a beta-sheet, as the nucleophile in the catalytic attack at the carbonyl carbon. The nucleophile is cysteine in GAT, serine in penicillin acylase, and threonine in the proteasome. All the enzymes share an unusual fold in which the nucleophile and other catalytic groups occupy equivalent sites. This fold provides both the capacity for nucleophilic attack and the possibility of autocatalytic processing [1].	NA	NA

PF09351	Domain of unknown function (DUF1993)	310	DinB-like superfamily	This superfamily are thought to be metalloenzymes.  They possess a four helical bundle core structure with a beta hairpin. Members of the superfamily have a predicted active site composed of three histidines that chelate Nickel or Zinc.  In some cases these histidines are replaced with Aspartate or Glutamate.  Mostly they form a dimeric structure. The dinB gene is one of the DNA-damage-induced genes and the corresponding protein, DinB, is the founding member of the clan. The protein contains a four-helix up-down-down-up bundle that has previously been described in the literature in three disparate proteins: the enzyme MDMPI (mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase), YfiT and TTHA0303, a member of a small DUF (domain of unknown function).  Most (but not all) clan members seem to have the ability to coordinate a metal ion using a conserved histidine-triad motif.  The proteins that share the fold exhibit four different quaternary structures: monomeric and three different dimeric forms [1].	NA	NA

PF09559	Cas6 Crispr	362	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins	This group of families is one of several protein families that are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].	NA	NA

PF10040	Uncharacterized conserved protein (DUF2276)	362	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins	This group of families is one of several protein families that are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].	NA	NA

PF10672	S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0008168	methyltransferase activity

PF10862	FcoT-like thioesterase domain	50	HotDog superfamily	The HotDog fold was first observed in the structure of Escherichia coli beta-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydratase (FabA), where Leesong et al. noticed that each subunit of this dimeric enzyme contained a mixed alpha + beta 'hot dog' fold. They described the seven-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet as the 'bun', which wraps around a five-turn alpha-helical 'sausage', This superfamily contains a diverse range of enzymes. Membership includes numerous prokaryotic, archaeal and eukaryotic proteins involved in several related, but distinct, catalytic activities, from metabolic roles such as thioester hydrolysis in fatty acid metabolism, to degradation of phenylacetic acid and the environmental pollutant 4-chlorobenzoate. The superfamily also includes FapR, a non-catalytic bacterial homologue that is involved in transcriptional regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis [1].	NA	NA

PF11104	Competence protein A	108	Actin-like ATPase Superfamily	The actin-like ATPase domain forms an alpha/beta canonical fold. The domain can be subdivided into 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B subdomains. Subdomains 1A and 1B share the same RNAseH-like fold (a five-stranded beta-sheet decorated by a number of alpha-helices). Domains 1A and 2A are conserved in all members of this superfamily, whereas domain 1B and 2B have a variable structure and are even missing from some homologues [1].  Within the actin-like ATPase domain the ATP-binding site is highly conserved. The phosphate part of the ATP is bound in a cleft between subdomains 1A and 2A, whereas the adenosine moiety is bound to residues from domains 2A and 2B[1].	NA	NA

PF11716	Mycothiol maleylpyruvate isomerase N-terminal domain	310	DinB-like superfamily	This superfamily are thought to be metalloenzymes.  They possess a four helical bundle core structure with a beta hairpin. Members of the superfamily have a predicted active site composed of three histidines that chelate Nickel or Zinc.  In some cases these histidines are replaced with Aspartate or Glutamate.  Mostly they form a dimeric structure. The dinB gene is one of the DNA-damage-induced genes and the corresponding protein, DinB, is the founding member of the clan. The protein contains a four-helix up-down-down-up bundle that has previously been described in the literature in three disparate proteins: the enzyme MDMPI (mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase), YfiT and TTHA0303, a member of a small DUF (domain of unknown function).  Most (but not all) clan members seem to have the ability to coordinate a metal ion using a conserved histidine-triad motif.  The proteins that share the fold exhibit four different quaternary structures: monomeric and three different dimeric forms [1].	0046872	metal ion binding
PF11717	RNA binding activity-knot of a chromodomain 	49	Tudor domain 'Royal family'	This clan covers the Tudor domain 'royal family' [1]. This includes chromo, MBT, PWWP and tudor domains.  The chromo domain is a comprised of approximately 50 amino acid residues. There are usually one to three Chromo domains found in a single protein. In some chromo domain containing proteins, a second related chromo domain has been found and is referred to as the Chromo-shadow domain.  The structure of the Chromo and Chromo-shadow domains reveal an OB-fold, a fold found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding proteins.\tMore specifically,the chromo-domain structure reveals a three beta strands that are packed against an alpha helix. Interestingly, a similar structure is found in the archaeal chromatin proteins (7kDa DNA-binding domain).  These are sequence neutral DNA binding proteins.\tThe DNA binding in these archaeal proteins is mediated through the triple stranded beta sheet. These archaeal domains are though to represent an ancestral chromo domain. Homologs of the chromo domain have been found in fission yeast, ciliated protozoa and all animal species, but appear to be absent in eubacteria, budding yeast and plants [2]. The precise function of the chromo domain is unclear, but the chromo domain is thought to act as a targeting module for chromosomal proteins, although the chromosomal contexts and functional contexts being targeted vary.  In all cases studies, the chromo domains are found in proteins that are involved in transcription regulation, positive and negative [2].	NA	NA

PF11813	Protein of unknown function (DUF3334)	355	CheC-like superfamily	The chemotactic response regulator superfamily are CheY-P phosphatases. Their structure is two intertwined alpha-beta-(X)-beta(2) motifs. This superfamily comprises two classes of proteins each shown to interact with the chemotaxis response regulator CheY: the FliM switch proteins and the CheC-type phosphatases [1]. FliM is a component of the flagellar switch found across the bacteria and is responsible for binding CheY-P and changing the rotational direction of the flagella. The N-terminal domain is CheC-like and the C-terminal shares the SpoA domain with FliN and FliY. The CheC family is broadly broken down into three phosphatase subfamilies: CheC, CheX, and FliY. All three have an active site consensus sequence of D/S-X(3)-E-X(2)-N-X(22)-P.	NA	NA

PF12147	Putative methyltransferase	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

PF12913	SH3 domain of the SH3b1 type	10	Src homology-3 domain	Src homology-3 (SH3) domains are comprised of about 60 amino acids, performing either an assembly or regulatory role.\t       For example, SH3 domains in the Grb2 adaptor protein  are essential for protein-protein interactions and\t\t      signal transduction in the p21 Ras-dependent growth factor signaling pathway.  Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].	NA	NA

PF13241	Putative NAD(P)-binding	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	0043115::0006779::0019354::0055114	precorrin-2 dehydrogenase activity::porphyrin-containing compound biosynthetic process::siroheme biosynthetic process::oxidation-reduction process

PF13393	Histidyl-tRNA synthetase	40	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS).

PF13847	Methyltransferase domain	63	FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	NA	NA

PF14450	Cell division protein FtsA	108	Actin-like ATPase Superfamily	The actin-like ATPase domain forms an alpha/beta canonical fold. The domain can be subdivided into 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B subdomains. Subdomains 1A and 1B share the same RNAseH-like fold (a five-stranded beta-sheet decorated by a number of alpha-helices). Domains 1A and 2A are conserved in all members of this superfamily, whereas domain 1B and 2B have a variable structure and are even missing from some homologues [1].  Within the actin-like ATPase domain the ATP-binding site is highly conserved. The phosphate part of the ATP is bound in a cleft between subdomains 1A and 2A, whereas the adenosine moiety is bound to residues from domains 2A and 2B[1].	NA	NA

PF14464	Prokaryotic homologs of the JAB domain	366	JAB-like superfamily	This superfamily includes a number of proteasome regulatory subunits, eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) subunits, regulators of transcription factors and ubiquitination-assisting protein families. In eukaryotes and in prokaryotic cognates of the ubiquitin-based  modification pathway, they function as ubiquitin isopeptidases/ deubiquitinases. JAB domains are also found in diverse metabolic pathways in prokaryotes such as siderophore and cysteine   biosynthesis. Other distinct versions of the JAB domain,  such as RadC are predicted to function as nucleases. Structurally, the  JAB domain is  related to the nucleotide deaminase and binds a Zinc ion in a similar structural location.	NA	NA
