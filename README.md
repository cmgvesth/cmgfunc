CMGfunc, functional protein annotation of bacterial proteins (Comparative Microbial Genomics functions)

CMGfunc is a pipeline for predicting functions of bacterial proteins and comparing the functional profiles between different organisms. The pipeline is distributed as a virtual computer and can be run on any virtualization software.

A virtual machine is a software based computer that runs as a "guest" system on a local computer, the "host". The computer runs within another program, called a "hypervisor" or a "virtualisation framework". The framework create eveyrthing the guest computer needs to run on the host, giving access to CPU, memory and diskspace as well as controlling connections between keyboard, network, printers and other hardware conenctions. The virtual computer boots like a normal machine but runs its own operating system and whatever software is installed on it. 

CMGfunc is a virtual machine in *.vmdk format and has been tested on the framework VirtualBox on both Windows and Mac OSX. The machine itself runs a version of xubuntu, where several programs have been removed and others added.
