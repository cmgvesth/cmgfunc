PSortb libraries
================

1) DESCRIPTION
--------------

libpsortb was created by Matthew Laird of the Brinkman Laboratory at Simon Fraser University.  It was created to provide a more user friendly installer for the various C and C++ libraries used by Psortb.  This library must be successfully be installed before the Perl bindings from the main Psortb package will work.

The package consist of repackaged versions of the following open source tools:

HMMER from the Washington University in St. Louis.  For more information on HMM, see the project homepage at:

  http://hmmer.wustl.edu/

libsvm written by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin at the National Taiwan University.  For more information on libsvm see the project homepage at:

http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm

modhmm, part of the prodiv_tmhmm package by Hakan Viklund at Stockholm University.  For more information on prodiv_tmhmm see the project homepage at:

http://www.pdc.kth.se/~hakanv/prodiv-tmhmm/

Full versions of the packages used as a basis for these customized versions of the libraries can be found at www.psort.org/downloads/src/

The author invites feedback on this library bundle.  If you find a bug, please send the information described in the BUGS section below.


2) INSTALLATION
---------------

libpsortb has been tested under linux/x86, linux/x86_64

Other operating systems are not supported at this time, but it doesn't mean the package won't work.  Testing has been a matter of access to different OS and hardware platforms.  If you have success with another platform, or would like our assistance porting the package to your platform please contact us.

Installation should be as simple as:

./configure
make
make install
ldconfig

configure takes the usual parameters, however the final libraries must be in a path that the dynamic linker from Perl can find.


3) DEPENDENCIES
---------------

libpsortb depends on an operating system which allows dynamically linked libraries.  These will be loaded by Perl and Psortb runtime.


4) BUGS
-------

If you find a bug, please report it to the author along with the
following information:

    * version of Perl (output of 'perl -V' is best)
    * version of libpsortb
    * operating system type and version
    * hardware description
    * exact text of error message or description of problem

If we don't have access to a system similar to yours, you may be asked
to insert some debugging lines and report back on the results.
The more help and information you can provide, the better.
