PSortb libraries
================

INSTALLATION
------------

libpsortb has been tested under linux/x86, linux/x86_64, OSX

Other operating systems are not supported at this time, but it doesn't mean the package won't work.  Testing has been a matter of access to different OS and hardware platforms.  If you have success with another platform, or would like our assistance porting the package to your platform please contact us.

Installation should be as simple as:

./configure
make
make install
ldconfig

configure takes the usual parameters, however the final libraries must be in a path that the dynamic linker from Perl can find.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

libpsortb depends on an operating system which allows dynamically linked libraries.  These will be loaded by Perl and Psortb runtime.
