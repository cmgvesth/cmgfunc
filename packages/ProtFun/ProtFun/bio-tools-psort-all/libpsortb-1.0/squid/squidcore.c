 *           
 *           Expects to be able to pick up defined macros:

 *           This gives us a general mechanism to update release information
 *           without changing multiple points in the code; we can also override
 *           SQUID release data with another package's release data (e.g.
 *           HMMER) just by redefining macros.
 * 
 * Args:     fp     - where to print it
